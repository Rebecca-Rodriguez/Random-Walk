# Random-Walk
For this project, I implemented variations on what is called a Random Walk. A random walk is a process that represents some number of successive steps within some mathematical space.

**Key features**:
* Start Button, 2 Checkboxes, 2 Sliders all functional
* Random Walk completes all at once, a total number of steps as indicated by the iterations slider
* Random Walk completes gradually, one frame a time. The number of steps taken each frame is determined by the step count slider
* Steps are colored according to the number of iterations
